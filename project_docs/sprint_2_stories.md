## User Stories

### Story S2.1: Implement 3D Scene with AI Orb
**As a** developer
**I want** to create a basic 3D scene with an animated AI Orb
**So that** users have a central visual interface for interaction

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. 3D scene renders correctly using React Three Fiber
2. AI Orb is implemented as a basic geometric shape (sphere/orb)
3. Basic animation states are implemented:
   - Idle state with subtle floating motion
   - Processing state with rotation/pulse
   - Success state with positive visual feedback
   - Error state with warning indication
4. Scene is responsive to window resizing
5. Basic lighting and shadows are implemented
6. Performance maintains 60fps on modern browsers

**Dependencies:** None

**Developer Notes:**
- Use @react-three/fiber and @react-three/drei for scene setup
- Implement animations using Three.js native capabilities
- Consider using React Suspense for loading states
- Ensure proper TypeScript types for all components
- Follow React Three Fiber best practices for performance

### Story S2.2: Implement Core State Management
**As a** developer
**I want** to set up a robust state management system
**So that** we can handle UI states and user interactions effectively

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Zustand store is properly configured with TypeScript
2. Core state slices are implemented:
   - UI state (loading, error, success states)
   - Orb state (animation states, interaction modes)
   - Session state (basic context management)
3. State changes trigger appropriate UI updates
4. State transitions are smooth and predictable
5. Developer tools integration for state debugging
6. Basic error handling is implemented

**Dependencies:**
- Partial dependency on S2.1 for Orb state integration

**Developer Notes:**
- Use Zustand middleware for persistence if needed
- Implement proper TypeScript types for all state
- Consider using immer for immutable state updates
- Add basic logging middleware for debugging

### Story S2.3: Create Landing Page Layout
**As a** developer
**I want** to implement a responsive landing page layout
**So that** users have a complete and intuitive interface

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Responsive layout using Tailwind CSS
2. 3D scene is properly centered and sized
3. Basic UI components are implemented:
   - Welcome message
   - Input area (placeholder for future text/voice input)
   - Status indicators
4. HeadlessUI components are integrated for:
   - Tooltips
   - Transitions
   - Accessibility features
5. Layout is responsive across desktop and tablet
6. Basic keyboard navigation is implemented
7. ARIA attributes are properly set

**Dependencies:**
- S2.1 for 3D scene integration
- S2.2 for state management integration

**Developer Notes:**
- Use Tailwind CSS for all styling
- Implement mobile-first responsive design
- Ensure proper TypeScript types for all components
- Follow Next.js 14 app router best practices
- Consider adding basic error boundaries

## Technical Rationale
These stories follow a logical progression that establishes the core visual and interactive foundation of Zaila. Starting with the 3D scene provides the central interface element, followed by state management to handle interactions, and finally the landing page to bring everything together in a cohesive user experience.
