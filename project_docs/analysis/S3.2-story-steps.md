Story S3.2 Implementation Steps:

Step 1. Implement Keyboard Navigation System
Must Support:
- Tab navigation through all interactive elements
- Visual focus indicators for keyboard navigation
- Keyboard shortcuts for primary actions
- Logical and intuitive tab order
Manual Verification:
- All interactive elements can be reached via keyboard
- Focus indicator is clearly visible at all times
- Keyboard shortcuts work as expected
- Tab order follows visual layout
Prerequisite: None
Developer Notes:
- Consider common keyboard interaction patterns
- Ensure focus indicators are highly visible
- Plan for different input modalities

Step 2. Enhance ARIA Implementation
Must Support:
- Descriptive ARIA labels for all interactive elements
- Proper role assignments for custom components
- State and property updates for dynamic content
- Relationship attributes between related elements
Manual Verification:
- Screen readers announce correct labels and roles
- Dynamic content changes are properly announced
- Related elements are properly connected
- Custom components have appropriate ARIA attributes
Prerequisite: Keyboard Navigation System
Developer Notes:
- Focus on meaningful descriptions
- Consider different screen reader behaviors
- Plan for dynamic content updates

Step 3. Establish Focus Management
Must Support:
- Focus trapping in modal dialogs
- Focus restoration after modal closure
- Skip links for main content areas
- Proper focus handling during content updates
Manual Verification:
- Focus remains trapped in active modals
- Focus returns to trigger after modal closes
- Skip links work as expected
- Focus moves appropriately with content changes
Prerequisite: ARIA Implementation
Developer Notes:
- Consider multiple dialog scenarios
- Plan for nested focusable elements
- Account for dynamic content changes

Step 4. Implement Status Announcements
Must Support:
- Live region updates for status changes
- Error message announcements
- Progress state notifications
- Action confirmation feedback
Manual Verification:
- Status changes are announced to screen readers
- Error messages are immediately announced
- Progress updates are properly communicated
- Actions are confirmed audibly
Prerequisite: Focus Management
Developer Notes:
- Consider announcement timing
- Plan for concurrent updates
- Account for different types of status changes

Step 5. Structure Content Hierarchy
Must Support:
- Logical heading structure
- Semantic HTML elements
- Clear content organization
- Consistent heading levels
Manual Verification:
- Heading structure makes logical sense
- Content is properly organized
- Semantic elements are used appropriately
- Navigation via headings works as expected
Prerequisite: None
Developer Notes:
- Focus on content organization
- Consider document outline
- Plan for dynamic content structure

Step 6. Implement WCAG Color Standards
Must Support:
- WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratios
- Non-color-dependent interactions
- Clear interactive state indicators
- Consistent visual hierarchy
Manual Verification:
- All text meets contrast requirements
- Information is not color-dependent
- Interactive states are clearly visible
- Visual hierarchy is maintained at all scales
Prerequisite: None
Developer Notes:
- Consider different visual conditions
- Plan for multiple contrast scenarios
- Account for different display settings
