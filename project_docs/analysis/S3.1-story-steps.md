Story S3.1 Implementation Steps:

Step 1. Establish Base Layout Structure
Must Support:
- Proper component positioning hierarchy
- Responsive container setup
- Basic layout grid system
Manual Verification:
- Page layout maintains structure at different viewport sizes
- Components have clear positioning relationships
- Content flows naturally in the layout
Prerequisite: None
Developer Notes:
- Consider mobile-first approach for responsive design
- Ensure proper spacing between components
- Plan for component scaling at different sizes

Step 2. Implement Welcome Message Integration
Must Support:
- Welcome message visibility
- Proper text hierarchy
- Message positioning
Manual Verification:
- Welcome message is clearly visible
- Text maintains readability at all sizes
- Message position is appropriate in layout
Prerequisite: Base Layout Structure
Developer Notes:
- Consider dynamic content requirements
- Plan for multilingual support
- Ensure consistent visual hierarchy

Step 3. Center and Integrate 3D Orb
Must Support:
- Centered orb positioning
- Responsive size adjustments
- Proper aspect ratio maintenance
Manual Verification:
- Orb remains centered at all viewport sizes
- Orb scales appropriately with viewport changes
- No visual distortion during resizing
Prerequisite: Base Layout Structure
Developer Notes:
- Consider loading states for 3D content
- Plan for fallback states
- Consider performance implications

Step 4. Position Input Area
Must Support:
- Strategic input placement
- Clear input boundaries
- Focus state handling
Manual Verification:
- Input area is easily accessible
- Input area maintains position across viewport sizes
- Focus states are clearly visible
Prerequisite: Base Layout Structure
Developer Notes:
- Consider input method accessibility
- Plan for input field expansion
- Consider autocomplete behavior

Step 5. Implement Status Indicators
Must Support:
- Clear status visibility
- State transition animations
- Status message display
Manual Verification:
- Status changes are clearly visible
- Transitions are smooth and natural
- Status messages are readable
Prerequisite: Input Area Integration
Developer Notes:
- Plan for multiple status types
- Consider status persistence rules
- Ensure status clarity

Step 6. Integrate State Management
Must Support:
- UI state synchronization
- State persistence
- Component state updates
Manual Verification:
- UI updates reflect state changes
- State persists through page reloads
- Components react to state updates
Prerequisite: All previous steps
Developer Notes:
- Consider state initialization order
- Plan for state recovery scenarios
- Consider state update performance
