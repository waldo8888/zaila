Story S3.3 Implementation Steps:

Step 1. Enable Persistent Storage System
Must Support:
- Storage of user preferences in browser storage
- Automatic saving of preference changes
- Loading of preferences on application start
- Fallback to default values when needed
Manual Verification:
- Changes to preferences persist after page reload
- Preferences are maintained between browser sessions
- Invalid stored data is handled gracefully
Prerequisite: None
Developer Notes:
- Consider data structure for preferences
- Plan for future preference additions
- Include version control for stored data format

Step 2. Enable Central State Management
Must Support:
- Single source of truth for application state
- Organized state structure by domain
- Efficient state updates and subscriptions
- State initialization process
Manual Verification:
- Components reflect state changes immediately
- State updates are consistent across the application
- Initial state loads correctly on startup
Prerequisite: Step 1
Developer Notes:
- Define clear state organization
- Consider state update patterns
- Plan for state dependencies

Step 3. Enable Visual Feedback System
Must Support:
- Loading state indicators
- Success/failure state feedback
- Transition animations between states
- Clear current state visualization
Manual Verification:
- Users can see when actions are in progress
- State changes are visually obvious
- Transitions feel smooth and natural
Prerequisite: Step 2
Developer Notes:
- Consider different types of state changes
- Plan for concurrent state updates
- Focus on user experience during transitions

Step 4. Enable Error Management System
Must Support:
- Centralized error state handling
- User-friendly error messages
- Error recovery workflows
- Error state persistence when needed
Manual Verification:
- Errors are clearly communicated to users
- Error states don't break the application
- Users can recover from error states
Prerequisite: Step 3
Developer Notes:
- Define error categories
- Plan error recovery paths
- Consider error state persistence needs

Step 5. Enable State Transition Control
Must Support:
- Defined state transition flows
- Prevention of invalid states
- Handling of interrupted transitions
- State history tracking
Manual Verification:
- State transitions follow expected paths
- Invalid state combinations are prevented
- Interrupted operations handle gracefully
Prerequisite: Step 4
Developer Notes:
- Define allowed state transitions
- Consider state validation rules
- Plan for complex state dependencies
