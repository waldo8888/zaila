# Implementation Status Analysis

## Current Implementation Status

### A. Completed Features
• Project Setup and Basic Configuration
  - Implementation evidence: package.json, tsconfig.json, tailwind.config.js, postcss.config.js
  - Functional status: Core project structure and dependencies are properly configured
  - Observable behaviors: Project can be built and developed using npm scripts

• Basic Project Structure
  - Implementation evidence: src/ directory with app/, components/, store/, and styles/ folders
  - Functional status: Next.js 14 app router structure is in place
  - Observable behaviors: Basic application structure follows Next.js conventions

### B. Partially Implemented Features
• 3D Scene Integration (REQ-101)
  - Current state: Basic directory structure for components exists
  - Missing functionality: Actual 3D scene implementation, AI Orb visualization
  - Required components: Scene.tsx, Orb component, animation states

• State Management (REQ-202, REQ-203)
  - Current state: Zustand store directory exists
  - Missing functionality: Context awareness, command interpretation
  - Required components: State models, action handlers

### C. Not Yet Implemented Features
• Natural Language Processing (REQ-200 series)
  - Required functionality: Command interpretation, context awareness
  - User-facing behaviors: Voice/text input processing
  - Dependencies: Core UI implementation

• Model Context Protocol (REQ-300 series)
  - Required functionality: MCP node system, tool creation
  - User-facing behaviors: Dynamic tool management
  - Dependencies: Basic UI and state management

• Integration Capabilities (REQ-400 series)
  - Required functionality: External service integration
  - User-facing behaviors: Connection to third-party services
  - Dependencies: Core system architecture

## Priority Order for Next Implementation Phase

### Priority 1 - Core UI and Interaction
- Complete 3D Scene Setup (Story 2)
  • Implement basic Three.js scene with React Three Fiber
  • Create placeholder AI Orb visualization
- Dependencies: None (can start immediately)
- Implementation rationale: Foundation for user interaction and visual feedback

### Priority 2 - Basic State Management
- Implement Zustand Store Structure
  • Set up basic state management for UI interactions
  • Implement basic command handling structure
- Dependencies: Core UI implementation
- Implementation rationale: Required for managing application state and user interactions

### Priority 3 - Landing Page Integration (Story 3)
- Create main application layout
  • Integrate 3D scene with responsive design
  • Implement basic UI components
- Dependencies: 3D Scene Setup, Basic State Management
- Implementation rationale: Provides complete user-facing interface
