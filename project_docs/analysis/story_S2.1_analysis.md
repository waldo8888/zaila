# Story S2.1 Analysis - Implement 3D Scene with AI Orb

## Story Details
**Description:** As a developer, I want to create a basic 3D scene with an animated AI Orb so that users have a central visual interface for interaction

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. 3D scene renders correctly using React Three Fiber
2. AI Orb is implemented as a basic geometric shape (sphere/orb)
3. Basic animation states are implemented:
   - Idle state with subtle floating motion
   - Processing state with rotation/pulse
   - Success state with positive visual feedback
   - Error state with warning indication
4. Scene is responsive to window resizing
5. Basic lighting and shadows are implemented
6. Performance maintains 60fps on modern browsers

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1. Enable Basic 3D Scene
Must Support:
- Scene container with proper dimensions
- Camera positioning and field of view
- Scene background and environment
Manual Verification:
- Empty 3D scene is visible on the page
- Scene fills the designated container area
- Scene maintains aspect ratio when window resizes
Prerequisite: None
Developer Notes:
- Consider viewport dimensions for scene sizing
- Ensure scene container is properly positioned in layout
- Focus on establishing proper scene boundaries

### Step 2. Enable Basic Orb Visualization
Must Support:
- Spherical geometry for the AI Orb
- Basic material properties (color, shininess)
- Proper positioning in scene center
Manual Verification:
- Orb is visible in the center of the scene
- Orb has appropriate size relative to viewport
- Orb surface has visible material properties
Prerequisite: Basic 3D Scene
Developer Notes:
- Consider orb size relative to viewport
- Ensure orb is visually distinct from background
- Focus on creating a clean, modern appearance

### Step 3. Enable Lighting System
Must Support:
- Main directional light for overall illumination
- Ambient light for base visibility
- Shadow mapping for depth perception
Manual Verification:
- Orb is properly illuminated from main light
- Shadows appear correctly on surfaces
- Scene has appropriate ambient brightness
Prerequisite: Basic Orb Visualization
Developer Notes:
- Consider light positioning for best visual effect
- Ensure shadows enhance depth perception
- Focus on creating a balanced lighting environment

### Step 4. Enable Idle Animation State
Must Support:
- Subtle floating motion
- Continuous animation loop
- Smooth transitions between animation frames
Manual Verification:
- Orb gently floats in place
- Motion appears smooth and natural
- Animation runs continuously without interruption
Prerequisite: Basic Orb Visualization
Developer Notes:
- Consider natural-feeling motion patterns
- Ensure animation is subtle and not distracting
- Focus on creating a calming idle state

### Step 5. Enable Interactive Animation States
Must Support:
- Processing state with rotation/pulse effect
- Success state with positive visual feedback
- Error state with warning indication
- Smooth transitions between states
Manual Verification:
- Processing state shows clear rotation/pulse
- Success state provides clear positive feedback
- Error state clearly indicates warning
- Transitions between states are smooth
- Each state is visually distinct
Prerequisite: Idle Animation State
Developer Notes:
- Consider clear visual distinction between states
- Ensure state changes are immediately noticeable
- Focus on intuitive visual feedback

### Step 6. Enable Performance Optimization
Must Support:
- Consistent 60fps frame rate
- Smooth animations under load
- Proper memory management
Manual Verification:
- Animations remain smooth during state changes
- No visible frame drops during transitions
- Performance remains stable during extended use
- Scene remains responsive during window resizing
Prerequisite: Interactive Animation States
Developer Notes:
- Consider viewport size impact on performance
- Ensure smooth operation across different states
- Focus on maintaining consistent user experience
