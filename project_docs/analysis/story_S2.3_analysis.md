- Status indicators reflect system state
- Components respond to state changes

### 4. Interactive Elements
**Required Functionality:**
- Tooltip system for UI elements
- Transition effects for state changes
- Focus management system
- Keyboard navigation paths

**Observable Behaviors:**

- Smooth transitions between states
- Clear focus indicators
- Logical tab order

### 5. Accessibility Implementation
**Required Functionality:**
- ARIA landmark regions
- Role assignments
- State announcements
- Focus management
- Skip navigation

**Observable Behaviors:**
- Screen readers announce content correctly
- Keyboard navigation works logically
- Focus visible at all times
- Interactive elements properly labeled

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Basic Layout Structure
**Must Support:**
- Viewport-aware container
- Main content area
- Proper spacing system
- Basic responsive grid

**Manual Verification:**
- Layout renders on all target screen sizes
- No unwanted scrollbars appear
- Content stays within bounds
- Spacing is consistent

**Prerequisites:** None

### Step 2: 3D Scene Container
**Must Support:**
- Scene viewport integration
- Proper z-index layering
- Responsive scaling
- Position management

**Manual Verification:**
- Scene visible and centered
- Scene scales appropriately
- No layout conflicts
- Proper layer ordering

**Prerequisites:** Step 1

### Step 3: Core UI Components
**Must Support:**
- Welcome message placement
- Input area structure
- Status indicator positions
- Component spacing

**Manual Verification:**
- All components visible
- Proper component alignment
- Consistent spacing
- Clear visual hierarchy

**Prerequisites:** Step 2

### Step 4: Interactive Features
**Must Support:**
- Tooltip containers
- Transition definitions
- Focus management system
- Keyboard navigation paths

**Manual Verification:**
- Tooltips show/hide correctly
- Transitions are smooth
- Focus visible and logical
- Keyboard navigation works

**Prerequisites:** Step 3

### Step 5: Accessibility Features
**Must Support:**
- ARIA attribute system
- Role definitions
- Focus management
- Screen reader support

**Manual Verification:**
- Screen reader announces correctly
- Keyboard navigation complete
- All interactions accessible
- ARIA attributes present

**Prerequisites:** Step 4

## Verification Approach

### Layout Testing
1. Check layout at all breakpoints
2. Verify content alignment
3. Test spacing consistency
4. Validate responsive behavior

### Component Testing
1. Verify all components present
2. Check component positioning
3. Validate state reflections
4. Test component interactions

### Accessibility Testing
1. Screen reader navigation
2. Keyboard-only navigation
3. Focus management
4. ARIA attribute verification

### Integration Testing
1. 3D scene interaction
2. State management reflection
3. Component coordination
4. Overall user flow

## Success Criteria
- Layout functions across all target screen sizes
- All UI components properly positioned and responsive
- Interactive elements work with mouse and keyboard
- Screen readers can navigate and announce content
- 3D scene properly integrated with UI layer
- State changes reflected in UI components
- All accessibility requirements met

## Dependencies
- Story S2.1 (3D Scene with AI Orb) must be completed for scene integration
- Story S2.2 (Core State Management) must be completed for state management integration
