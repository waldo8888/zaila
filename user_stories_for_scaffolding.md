# Initial Scaffolding User Stories for Zaila

## Overview
These user stories focus on establishing the basic project structure and core frameworks for Zaila. The goal is to create a minimal working application that demonstrates successful integration of our key technologies: Next.js, React Three Fiber, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## User Stories

### Story 1: Project Setup and Basic Navigation
**As a** developer  
**I want** to set up the initial Next.js project with all core dependencies  
**So that** I have a working development environment with proper TypeScript and Tailwind CSS configuration

**Technical Notes:**
- Use Next.js 14.0.4 with TypeScript
- Initialize project with provided package.json, tsconfig.json, and tailwind.config.js
- Set up src/ directory structure following Next.js 14 app router convention

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Running `npm install` successfully installs all dependencies
2. `npm run dev` starts the development server without errors
3. Basic Next.js app router structure exists:
   ```
   src/
     app/
       layout.tsx
       page.tsx
     components/
     styles/
       globals.css
   ```
4. Tailwind CSS is working (verify by using a Tailwind class)
5. TypeScript compilation succeeds without errors

### Story 2: Basic 3D Scene Setup
**As a** developer  
**I want** to set up a basic Three.js scene using React Three Fiber  
**So that** we have the foundation for the AI Orb interface

**Technical Notes:**
- Use @react-three/fiber 8.15.12 and @react-three/drei 9.92.7
- Create a basic canvas component in src/components/3d/
- Implement a simple spinning cube as a placeholder for the AI Orb

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. A new component exists at src/components/3d/Scene.tsx
2. The scene renders a basic 3D object (cube) in the center
3. Basic lighting and camera controls are implemented
4. The scene is responsive to window resizing
5. No console errors related to Three.js or React Three Fiber

### Story 3: Landing Page Integration
**As a** developer  
**I want** to create a landing page that integrates the 3D scene  
**So that** we have a working proof of concept of our core technologies

**Technical Notes:**
- Use Tailwind CSS for layout and styling
- Implement basic Zustand store for state management
- Create a centered layout with the 3D scene as the focal point

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Landing page displays a welcome message: "Welcome to Zaila"
2. 3D scene is properly integrated and centered
3. Basic state management is set up with Zustand
4. Page is responsive and follows basic accessibility guidelines
5. All components are properly typed with TypeScript
6. No TypeScript or console errors

## Definition of Done (Applies to All Stories)
- Code follows TypeScript best practices
- Components use proper type definitions
- Code passes linting (`npm run lint`)
- Code passes type checking (`npm run type-check`)
- Changes are committed to version control
- Development server runs without errors
- Application renders correctly in Chrome and Firefox

## Technical Context
- **Framework**: Next.js 14.0.4 with TypeScript 5.3.3
- **3D Graphics**: React Three Fiber 8.15.12 with Three.js 0.160.0
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.4.0 with HeadlessUI 1.7.17
- **State Management**: Zustand 4.4.7

## Out of Scope
- Authentication/Authorization
- Backend integration
- Complex 3D models or animations
- Production deployment
- Testing
- Data persistence
- Complex state management
- Advanced features of the AI Orb
